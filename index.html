  <div class="entry-content"><p>A common question that we always get is why vimana is a software-as-a-service (SaaS) product. Surely, given how much data we are collecting, it must be easier to run it locally inside a plant, right? Well, if all vimana was doing was creating plots of part counts and utilization, then yes, running it locally does make sense. But vimana does a lot more &#8211; it helps understand the patterns behind productivity (and the lack thereof), and being able to support these capabilities requires a whole lot more of computational resources.</p>

<p>So lets dig deeper &#8211; why SaaS?</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Keep it Growing</strong>: SaaS allows us to scale product functionality as your operations grow. This means that vimana can scale to support an increasing number of devices, along with the analytical capabilities required to support them. SaaS also allows us to keep the app at the latest version without requiring long downtimes for the updates.</li>
<li><strong>Keep it All</strong>: SaaS allows us to keep historical plant data securely for as long as you want us to. This makes it possible to baseline against historical data to put current performance in context, and to make better decisions about the future based on past usage and operational patterns.</li>
<li><strong>Keep it Lean</strong>: SaaS enables simple, annual, pay-as-you-go pricing, where you pay based on the number of devices you have connected to vimana, and the kind of analysis being performed on the devices. Since the app is delivered over the web, any number of users can access it (even simultaneously!).</li>
</ol>


<p>SaaS deployments also allow us to farm out specific analytical processes to elastic clusters, using map reduce and other big-data-crunching technologies. We will be talking about this in detail in upcoming posts.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Why do we care</h2>

<p>We use mongoDB to persist data from the vimana tenants. All historical data from our customers is stored in mongo, and its very important that we can continuously persist into mongo without losing data. We are using replica sets to make sure that our data is redundantly stored and to ensure that we have a failover mechanism when one of the mongoDBs lose connection.</p>

<h2>Introduction to Replica Sets</h2>

<p>Replica sets are a form of asynchronous master/slave replication, adding automatic failover and automatic recovery of member nodes. A replica set consists of two or more nodes that are copies of each other. (i.e.: replicas). The replica set automatically elects a primary (master). Drivers (and mongos) can automatically detect when a replica set primary changes and will begin sending writes to the new primary.</p>

<h2>Those GOTCHAs</h2>

<p>In order enable replica sets, you need to pass the &#8220;replSet&#8221; parameter while starting the mongod processes.
Replica sets cannot be initiated on those mongod instance which were already started with out &#8220;replSet&#8221; parameter.  Stop and restart the mongod processes with replSet parameter.
When replica sets are configured, all the writes will only go to the primary!!! Mongo has its own algorithms for syncing the data across the nodes.</p>

<h2>That setup</h2>

<p>Starting multiple mongo instances.</p>

<pre><code>$ mongod --dbpath mongo_rpl/data1 --replSet set1 --port 27018
$ mongod --dbpath mongo_rpl/data2 --replSet set1 --port 27019
$ mongod --dbpath mongo_rpl/data3 --replSet set1 --port 27020
</code></pre>

<p>This starts 3 different instances of mongo running on different ports.</p>

<h2>Setting up the replica config</h2>

<pre><code>➜  ~  mongo localhost:27018
MongoDB shell version: 1.8.2
Mon Apr 30 11:13:59 *** warning: spider monkey build without utf8 support.  consider rebuilding with utf8 support
connecting to: localhost:27018/test
&gt; config = {_id: "set1", members: [{_id: 0, host: "localhost:27018"}, {_id: 1, host: "localhost:27019"},{_id: 2, host:"localhost:27020"}]}
{
   "_id" : "set1",
  "members" : [
 {
    "_id" : 0, 
   "host" : "localhost:27018"
},
{
   "_id" : 1,
  "host" : "localhost:27019"
},
{
   "_id" : 2,
  "host" : "localhost:27020"
}
]
}
&gt; rs.initiate(config)
{
   "info" : "Config now saved locally.  Should come online in about a minute.",
  "ok" : 1
}
&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This config enables the replicas to talk with each other. The talking would involve the replicas communicating who is the primary and who are all the secondaries.</p>

<h2>That app</h2>

<p>We wrote a <a href="https://github.com/deepakprasanna/mongo_oplog_watcher">small app</a> which would tail the oplog of our test servers and insert some interesting records into the replicas.</p>

<h2>Those observations</h2>

<p>The most interesting part of playing with replica sets is to understand how mongoDB behaves and handles a node failure.
I have classified my observations into two catagories, a node failure during a read and during a write.</p>

<h3>Reading Scenarios</h3>

<p>MongoDB doesnot by default support serving reads from the replicas. MongoDB will serve all reads from primary by default. Reads from secondaries can be configured, which is actually a 2 step process.  The first step is to configure &#8220;slaveOK&#8221; in the mongo console. This will tell mongo, it is okay to serve the reads from the secondaries. The second step is to instantiate the MongoReplConnection with :read => :secondary option.
This will tell the driver that it is okay to send the reads to the secondaries. Mongo driver will randomly select one of the secondaries to serve the reads. The distribution of the reads across the secondaries is handled by the driver.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Secondary goes down:</strong> <br/>
<strong>slaveOk:</strong> <code>Mongo::ConnectionFailure</code> will be raised when there is a failure. Mongo driver is intelligent, when it sees a <code>Mongo::ConnectionFailure</code> it prevents the next reads from going to that dead secondary.
The driver has its own algorithm to find out if the dead secondary is back alive or not. As far a read is concerned we need to catch <code>Mongo::ConnectionFailure</code> and make the read once more(Assuming that another secondary will be up).
If the secondaries are configured to serve the reads, then the primary is not touched at all until all other secondaries are dead. But there is no real way to find out which mongod instance served the read. <br/>
<strong>Without SlaveOk:</strong>  Rest of the world goes as usual.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Primary goes down:</strong>  <br/>
<strong>slaveOk:</strong> Rest of the world goes as usual. <br/>
<strong>without SlaveOk:</strong> All the reads are going to fail since primary can only serve the reads. There are 2 ways to solve this problem, catch the exception and throw an error message. Or keep polling the server until one of the other secondaries becomes a primary and read becomes successful. If the client decides to retry, it&#8217;s not guaranteed that another member of the replica set will have been promoted to primary right away, so it&#8217;s still possible that the driver will raise another <code>Mongo::ConnectionFailure</code>.</p></li>
</ul>


<h3>Writing scenarios</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Secondary goes down:</strong> When replica sets are configured in mongoDB, all the writes go to the primary. So there is no problem at all if a secondary goes down.
If the secondary comes up again, mongo will take care of replicating the records which were lost by the time when it was down. Perfect!</li>
<li><strong>Primary goes down:</strong> The ruby mongo driver raises <code>Mongo::ConnectionFailure</code>. Checkout the oplog watcher, we have caught this exception and we are doing a <code>puts</code> that the connection is lost.
  But how ever the after a few seconds, when one of the other secondaries get elected as the primary the writes become successful. The interesting fact is that all the writes which failed
  during this recovery process is lost. Since we are able to catch <code>Mongo::ConnectionFailure</code>, it is up-to the client to pull the sleeves and persist the data somewhere else until another
  secondary becomes a primary.While testing we lost about 20-30 records when the primary was down. I guess this number would be more or less depending the latency which we would face in the realtime.</li>
<li><strong>Last mongod instance is not becoming primary:</strong> As you can see from the config above, we have 3 replicas. So we would have one primary(27018) and two secondaries(27019 and 27020). We are stopping the primary(27018). Now one of the secondaries becomes a primary(say 28019). Now we would have one primary(27019) and one secondary(27020). Again we are stopping the primary(27019). But the left over secondary(27020) will not become the primary!!!!!!! This causes all the writes to fail. But if we bring another dead mongod instance(27018) up, the leftover secondary(27020) becomes the primary and from then on the writes become successful.  This was found while digging into the mongo logs.</li>
</ul>


<p><code>[rs Manager] replSet can't see a majority, will not try to elect self:</code></p>

<p>From what I understand , Replica sets will do the election process only if there are 2 or more replicas available. If at all we have only one replica alive, the election will not happen and all the writes will fail because there will be no primary. We need have 2 replicas alive at anytime for the writes to become successful. This is interesting.</p>

<p>Happy hacking, <br/>
Deepak.</p>

<time datetime="2012-03-21T13:47:00+05:30" pubdate data-updated="true">Mar 21<span>st</span>, 2012</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>We are back studying McKinsey&#8217;s report on Big Data following the last post, and here lets take a closer look at what we can do with Big Data. The report identifies several &#8220;levers&#8221; where data can be used to improve manufacturing performance (see below), and of these levers, we are primarily interested in these two:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/2012-03-21-McKinsey-Part-2-What-do-do-with-it-levers.png"></p>

<ol>
<li>Implementing Lean Manufacturing (#5)</li>
<li>Using sensor data-driven operations analytics (#6)</li>
</ol>


<p>Lets look at the first of these in this post.</p>

<h2>Lean Manufacturing and the Digital Factory</h2>

<p>McKinsey identifies using Big Data to &#8220;create process transparency, develop dashboards, and visualize bottlenecks&#8221;. Our vimana application is one example of applying Big Data to create realtime dashboards of manufacturing equipment (to learn more about vimana, please visit www.systeminsights.com/vimana.) The idea here is to provide a shopfloor user both a high-level &#8220;macro&#8221; view of the shopfloor, as well as a low-level &#8220;micro&#8221; view of a single device.  Questions the dashboards can help answer include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Which devices are producing parts today?</li>
<li>Which parts are being made right now?</li>
<li>How many parts have I made?</li>
<li>What has my device been doing today?</li>
<li>What is my efficiency?</li>
<li>Why have I been in a downtime?
  (This is a much more interesting question to answer than just &#8220;What are my downtimes&#8221;. Knowing <em>why</em> downtimes occur can directly help in reducing or eliminating the downtimes, and is a step beyond simply knowing <em>that</em> a has downtime occurred).</li>
</ul>


<p>The data for vimana is streamed using the MTConnect Agent associated with each machine tool. The application itself runs in the cloud, aggregating hundreds of events every second from each machine tool. The analysis is done in realtime, and the visualizations are rendered instantly. Process transparency is achieved here because the application serves as a central repository of what is going on in the shopfloor, and multiple stakeholders (production, engineering, maintenance, management) can all use it to support decisions that come under their purview. This also takes us one step closer to the Digital Factory, where detailed operational data from the factory equipment is applied in building a complete digital model of the factory&#8217;s operations, which can then be applied in optimizing its performance.</p>

<p><em>Macro Dashboard: Shopfloor</em>
<img class="center" src="/images/2012-03-21-McKinsey-Part-2-What-do-do-with-it-dashboard.png"></p>

<p><em>Micro Dashboard: Device</em>
<img class="center" src="/images/2012-03-21-McKinsey-Part-2-What-do-do-with-it-details.png"></p>

<p>Coming back to McKinsey, they estimate a reduction of 10 to 50% in costs from applying Big Data to implement Lean Manufacturing and the Digital Factory, accompanied by a marginal increase in revenue (2%). We have already seen vimana helping improve device utilization by over 25%, which directly leads to cost reductions. The real impact of Big Data here is not as much as in enabling us to ask new questions about a shop&#8217;s productivity, but in helping us find even better answers for the same questions we have been asking for a long time and thus driving down costs. Of course, thats not to say that we cannot ask new questions based on the data –this is where data specifically from ubiquitous and low cost sensors can play a role, which we will examine in a future post.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was blogged first at my personal blog <a href="http://princearora.wordpress.com/2012/02/24/setting-up-a-mtconnect-agent-on-a-unixubuntu-machine/">here</a>.</p>

<p>While working on my internship project, I got a chance to test out an MTConnect agent built in C++ for Linux (ubuntu). I was surprised to find that absolutely no documentation existed for setting up the Agent in a Linux environment. Although it didn&#8217;t turn out to be a big hassle in the end, I thought that it would be a good idea to list down the process of setting up a MTConnect agent on Linux. So, here you go:</p>

<ul>
<li>Download the zip archive of the latest version of MTConnect C++ Agent SDK from MTConnect Github and extract its contents onto your local disk.</li>
<li><p>Download &amp; Install libxml-2.0 and libxml-dev packages from the apt repository.</p>

<pre><code>  $ apt-get install libxml2
  $ apt-get install libxml2-dev
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Now you need to prepare a Makefile in order to compile the agent. This can be done using the Cmake package. Download &amp; install cmake if you don&#8217;t already have it.</p>

<pre><code>  $ apt-get install cmake     
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Open the &#8216;agent&#8217; folder in the terminal and run cmake and make.</p>

<pre><code>  $ cd agent/
  $ cmake .
  $ make 
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>If everything went right, your agent would have been build. You can now start it off as a service.</p>

<pre><code>  $ ./agent daemonize 
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>If you are unsure whether the process is running, you can check out the process status:</p>

<pre><code>  $ ps aux | grep agent 
</code></pre></li>
</ul>


<p>The agent service should be up and running. You may change the agent.cfg file in any text editor based on the instructions here.</p>

<p>Have fun!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I want to introduce Prince Arora, a student from IIT Madras, who is interning with us at our Chennai office. Prince is developing a suite of MTConnect-based tools to track the maintenance status of machine tools. He is blogging about his experiences at System Insights at his blog, <a href="http://princearora.in">The 20four hour log</a>.</p>

<p>Prince started out by building a simple webapp to display various maintenance-related parameters from an MTConnect data stream. Specifically <a href="http://princearora.wordpress.com/2012/02/14/mtconnect-the-problem-statement/">he developed an app</a> to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Connect to any MTConnect Stream specified by the user</li>
<li>Recognize all the devices within the stream</li>
<li>Continuously read &amp; display multiple parameters for each of the device</li>
<li>Display condition of all components</li>
<li>Plot a curve of the variation of a parameter over time</li>
<li>Allow user to monitor a parameter and alarm if it moves outside the range of values entered</li>
</ul>


<p>Here is a screenshot of viewing realtime data from an MTConnect Agent. The app plots the value of an MTConnect Sample DataItem in realtime. The screen below shows the app plotting the X position, but this can also be used to plot maintenance-related data like a vibration or temperature.</p>

<p>You can also load up the status of various conditions active in the machine tool, and see if the parameter that is being plotted is within some user-determined bounds. The screen below shows bounds set for the DataItem Commanded Y Position between 3 and -2. A green indication is shown because the data item is operating within bounds.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/2012-03-16-Introducing-our-Intern-Price-Arora-pic-2.jpeg"></p>

<p>Prince will be posting more about his internship in these pages. Stay tuned!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I will producing a series of MTConnect screencasts in the near future on various topics. The first in the series will cover extending the MTConnect standard by adding custom Data Items and Components. The tutorial will take you through all the steps necessary to develop an extension using the open source tools and deploy an integrated solution with all the schema files deployed on the MTConnect Agent. I am working on the screen casts right now and learning my way through the various technologies necessary to make a usable online education series.</p>

<p>If this is a success, we will be producing additional tutorials on adapter development demonstrating how to get data from machine tools as well as many more. Another I&#8217;m considering will provide guidance on collecting tooling data from your controller and publishing it through MTConnect in compliance with part 1.2. All the source code, tools, and documentation will be made freely available to the community. I am currently looking for an XMLSpy equivalent or at least a good schema validator to use since XMLSpy has a high price tag. If anyone knows of anything, please reply. Any help in that area will be appreciated. I have used XMLSpy for many years, but for the purposes of these tutorials, I don&#8217;t want to burden everyone with the cost, even though it is a great tool.</p>

<p>If there are any tutorials you would be interested in seeing, I will be taking suggestions and will prioritize based on the responses I get. Otherwise I will make up my own priorities and guess as best I can what the community would like to see&#8230;</p>
