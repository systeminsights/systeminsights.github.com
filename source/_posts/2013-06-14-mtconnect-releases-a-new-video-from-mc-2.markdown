Excellent video from MC <sup>2</sup> conference starring Jake Ervin. This was shot at the MC<sup>2</sup> conference in April and Jake is -- sadly -- trying to strike up a meaningful conversation with a machine tool. I make a cameo at the end of the video. After watching myself, I've lost all aspirations of acting. Better stick to my day job!
