Jesus Nieto Gonzalez from the UC Berkeley Haas School of Business Class of 2014 worked with us on a research project to identify the top energy consumers in the manufacturing sector. Here are some of his findings:

- The top five energy-intensive industries are Paper, Petroleum and Coal products, Nonmetallic Mineral Products, Chemicals, and Primary Metals (measured based on BTU/$ output)
- The paper industry has the highest electricity consumption as well, followed by Primary Metals and Textile Mills (measured based on kWH/$)
- The EU countries (particularly Italy and Germany) have some of the highest electricity costs for Industrial consumers, followed by the BRIC countries and the US
- The paper industry offers a lot of opportunities for energy efficiency and electrical energy reduction. The industry is highly fragmented and the major paper producers are concentrated in parts of the world with high electricity costs.
