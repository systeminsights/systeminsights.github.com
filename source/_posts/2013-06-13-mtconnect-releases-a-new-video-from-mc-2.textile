Excellent video from MC ^2^ conference staring Jake Ervin. This was
shot at the MC ^2^ conference in April and Jake, sadly, trying to strike up
a meaningful conversation with a machine tool. I make a cameo at the
end of the video. After watching myself, I've lost all aspirations of
acting. Better stick to my day job!
