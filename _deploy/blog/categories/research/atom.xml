    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Had questions about Green Manufacturing but were too bashful to ask? You are in luck, you can pick up a copy of the excellent &ldquo;Green Manufacturing: Fundamentals and Applications&rdquo; from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Green-Manufacturing-Fundamentals-Applications-Technology/dp/1441960155/">Amazon.com</a> and other fashionable purveyors of fine reading material. Full Disclosure: I have co-authored 4 chapters in the book, including the penultimate chapter &ldquo;Enabling Technologies for Assuring Green Manufacturing&rdquo;, which, among other things, talks  about the need for a highly scalable software architecture to enable realtime monitoring and reporting of manufacturing performance (hint: we have a built a little <a href="http://www.systeminsights.com/vimana">product</a> to address that need).</p>

<p>&ldquo;Green Manufacturing&rdquo; is based on research from the <a href="http://lmas.berkeley.edu">Laboratory for Manufacturing and Sustainability</a> and is edited by Prof. David Dornfeld, the Director of LMAS and the Chairman of the Department of Mechanical Engineering at UC Berkeley. For more information, you can check out his excellent <a href="http://green-manufacturing.blogspot.com">blog</a>.</p>
