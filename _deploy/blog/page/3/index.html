  <div class="entry-content"><p>We are back studying McKinsey&rsquo;s report on Big Data following the last post, and here lets take a closer look at what we can do with Big Data. The report identifies several &ldquo;levers&rdquo; where data can be used to improve manufacturing performance (see below), and of these levers, we are primarily interested in these two:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/2012-03-21-McKinsey-Part-2-What-do-do-with-it-levers.png"></p>

<ol>
<li>Implementing Lean Manufacturing (#5)</li>
<li>Using sensor data-driven operations analytics (#6)</li>
</ol>


<p>Lets look at the first of these in this post.</p>

<h2>Lean Manufacturing and the Digital Factory</h2>

<p>McKinsey identifies using Big Data to &ldquo;create process transparency, develop dashboards, and visualize bottlenecks&rdquo;. Our vimana application is one example of applying Big Data to create realtime dashboards of manufacturing equipment (to learn more about vimana, please visit www.systeminsights.com/vimana.) The idea here is to provide a shopfloor user both a high-level &ldquo;macro&rdquo; view of the shopfloor, as well as a low-level &ldquo;micro&rdquo; view of a single device.  Questions the dashboards can help answer include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Which devices are producing parts today?</li>
<li>Which parts are being made right now?</li>
<li>How many parts have I made?</li>
<li>What has my device been doing today?</li>
<li>What is my efficiency?</li>
<li>Why have I been in a downtime?
  (This is a much more interesting question to answer than just &ldquo;What are my downtimes&rdquo;. Knowing <em>why</em> downtimes occur can directly help in reducing or eliminating the downtimes, and is a step beyond simply knowing <em>that</em> a has downtime occurred).</li>
</ul>


<p>The data for vimana is streamed using the MTConnect Agent associated with each machine tool. The application itself runs in the cloud, aggregating hundreds of events every second from each machine tool. The analysis is done in realtime, and the visualizations are rendered instantly. Process transparency is achieved here because the application serves as a central repository of what is going on in the shopfloor, and multiple stakeholders (production, engineering, maintenance, management) can all use it to support decisions that come under their purview. This also takes us one step closer to the Digital Factory, where detailed operational data from the factory equipment is applied in building a complete digital model of the factory&rsquo;s operations, which can then be applied in optimizing its performance.</p>

<p><em>Macro Dashboard: Shopfloor</em>
<img class="center" src="/images/2012-03-21-McKinsey-Part-2-What-do-do-with-it-dashboard.png"></p>

<p><em>Micro Dashboard: Device</em>
<img class="center" src="/images/2012-03-21-McKinsey-Part-2-What-do-do-with-it-details.png"></p>

<p>Coming back to McKinsey, they estimate a reduction of 10 to 50% in costs from applying Big Data to implement Lean Manufacturing and the Digital Factory, accompanied by a marginal increase in revenue (2%). We have already seen vimana helping improve device utilization by over 25%, which directly leads to cost reductions. The real impact of Big Data here is not as much as in enabling us to ask new questions about a shop&rsquo;s productivity, but in helping us find even better answers for the same questions we have been asking for a long time and thus driving down costs. Of course, thats not to say that we cannot ask new questions based on the data –this is where data specifically from ubiquitous and low cost sensors can play a role, which we will examine in a future post.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was blogged first at my personal blog <a href="http://princearora.wordpress.com/2012/02/24/setting-up-a-mtconnect-agent-on-a-unixubuntu-machine/">here</a>.</p>

<p>While working on my internship project, I got a chance to test out an MTConnect agent built in C++ for Linux (ubuntu). I was surprised to find that absolutely no documentation existed for setting up the Agent in a Linux environment. Although it didn&rsquo;t turn out to be a big hassle in the end, I thought that it would be a good idea to list down the process of setting up a MTConnect agent on Linux. So, here you go:</p>

<ul>
<li>Download the zip archive of the latest version of MTConnect C++ Agent SDK from MTConnect Github and extract its contents onto your local disk.</li>
<li><p>Download &amp; Install libxml-2.0 and libxml-dev packages from the apt repository.</p>

<pre><code>  $ apt-get install libxml2
  $ apt-get install libxml2-dev
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Now you need to prepare a Makefile in order to compile the agent. This can be done using the Cmake package. Download &amp; install cmake if you don&rsquo;t already have it.</p>

<pre><code>  $ apt-get install cmake     
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Open the &lsquo;agent&rsquo; folder in the terminal and run cmake and make.</p>

<pre><code>  $ cd agent/
  $ cmake .
  $ make 
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>If everything went right, your agent would have been build. You can now start it off as a service.</p>

<pre><code>  $ ./agent daemonize 
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>If you are unsure whether the process is running, you can check out the process status:</p>

<pre><code>  $ ps aux | grep agent 
</code></pre></li>
</ul>


<p>The agent service should be up and running. You may change the agent.cfg file in any text editor based on the instructions here.</p>

<p>Have fun!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I want to introduce Prince Arora, a student from IIT Madras, who is interning with us at our Chennai office. Prince is developing a suite of MTConnect-based tools to track the maintenance status of machine tools. He is blogging about his experiences at System Insights at his blog, <a href="http://princearora.in">The 20four hour log</a>.</p>

<p>Prince started out by building a simple webapp to display various maintenance-related parameters from an MTConnect data stream. Specifically <a href="http://princearora.wordpress.com/2012/02/14/mtconnect-the-problem-statement/">he developed an app</a> to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Connect to any MTConnect Stream specified by the user</li>
<li>Recognize all the devices within the stream</li>
<li>Continuously read &amp; display multiple parameters for each of the device</li>
<li>Display condition of all components</li>
<li>Plot a curve of the variation of a parameter over time</li>
<li>Allow user to monitor a parameter and alarm if it moves outside the range of values entered</li>
</ul>


<p>Here is a screenshot of viewing realtime data from an MTConnect Agent. The app plots the value of an MTConnect Sample DataItem in realtime. The screen below shows the app plotting the X position, but this can also be used to plot maintenance-related data like a vibration or temperature.</p>

<p>You can also load up the status of various conditions active in the machine tool, and see if the parameter that is being plotted is within some user-determined bounds. The screen below shows bounds set for the DataItem Commanded Y Position between 3 and -2. A green indication is shown because the data item is operating within bounds.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/2012-03-16-Introducing-our-Intern-Price-Arora-pic-2.jpeg"></p>

<p>Prince will be posting more about his internship in these pages. Stay tuned!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I will producing a series of MTConnect screencasts in the near future on various topics. The first in the series will cover extending the MTConnect standard by adding custom Data Items and Components. The tutorial will take you through all the steps necessary to develop an extension using the open source tools and deploy an integrated solution with all the schema files deployed on the MTConnect Agent. I am working on the screen casts right now and learning my way through the various technologies necessary to make a usable online education series.</p>

<p>If this is a success, we will be producing additional tutorials on adapter development demonstrating how to get data from machine tools as well as many more. Another I&rsquo;m considering will provide guidance on collecting tooling data from your controller and publishing it through MTConnect in compliance with part 1.2. All the source code, tools, and documentation will be made freely available to the community. I am currently looking for an XMLSpy equivalent or at least a good schema validator to use since XMLSpy has a high price tag. If anyone knows of anything, please reply. Any help in that area will be appreciated. I have used XMLSpy for many years, but for the purposes of these tutorials, I don&rsquo;t want to burden everyone with the cost, even though it is a great tool.</p>

<p>If there are any tutorials you would be interested in seeing, I will be taking suggestions and will prioritize based on the responses I get. Otherwise I will make up my own priorities and guess as best I can what the community would like to see&hellip;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>McKinsey recently published a report about Big Data, going into considerable detail about its impact on different fields, including manufacturing. In the next few posts, I will be digging into this report looking at the specific impacts of big data on machining-related manufacturing, focusing on ways that improve productivity and efficiency.
First, lets start with how the &ldquo;Big Data&rdquo; is defined:</p>

<blockquote><p>“Big data” refers to datasets whose size is beyond the ability of typical database software tools to capture, store, manage, and analyze. This definition is intentionally subjective and incorporates a moving definition of how big a dataset needs to be in order to be considered big data—i.e., we don’t define big data in terms of being larger than a certain number of terabytes (thousands of gigabytes).</p></blockquote>

<p>This definition applies remarkably well to Manufacturing Big Data. The &ldquo;bigness&rdquo; of the data is not necessarily its absolute size, because process data from a machine tool might be in the tens of gigabytes, which is paltry compared to Internet data like website click-throughs or ad impressions. The bigness comes from the fact that traditional manufacturing decision making systems (spreadsheets, sticky-notes-on-whiteboards, MES systems) deal with very small sets of data – perhaps in the megabytes – and we are now looking at harnessing data that is several orders of magnitude larger than that.</p>

<p>So how much data are we exactly talking about? Lets take the case of collecting MTConnect-based data streams from manufacturing equipment. With Basic monitoring (looking at production efficiency, part count, alarms, messages, and overrides), we can estimate a data rate of about 10 samples a second, with each sample consisting of 10 data items. This generates over 400MB of data daily, or more than 150GB annually per device. With Advanced monitoring (which will complement Basic monitoring with data from embedded and external sensors), this grows to over 21 GB a day, or close to 8 TB a year. With these estimates, a small manufacturing shop with about 10 devices, wil generate over 2 TB of data a day with Basic monitoring, or close to 80 TB with Advanced monitoring. Moving up to a multi-facility enterprise with about 500 devices, we are looking at about 80 TB a year with Basic monitoring, and close to 4 PB (Petabytes) with Advanced monitoring. The table below gives a few more examples.</p>

<iframe frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0AnJkF2eeISMAdG5yTjZ4TkgyVEVEWE5rM2E5bmE1eUE&amp;single=true&amp;gid=0&amp;output=html&amp;widget=true" width="500"></iframe>


<p>If we extrapolated this further to look at the total number of machine tools currently installed in the United States today (approximately 1.2 Million, based on estimates from AMT), Basic monitoring will generate over 189 PB of data, while Advanced monitoring will generate over 9,400 PB of data (over 9.4 Exabytes). Of course, this does overstate the total data load since not all of these machines can be readily addressed, but it gives a sense of the scale of manufacturing data, and &mdash; more importantly &mdash; the opportunity to harness it.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/2012-02-14-McKinsey-Part-1-How-Much-Data-Sectoral-Data-Storage.png"></p>

<p>McKinsey estimates about 966 PB of stored data in the Discrete Manufacturing sector (see above). Add Process data to that, we are looking at greatly increasing the total storage requirements of the sector. Manufacturing has the largest storage needs of all the surveyed sectors, and the potential of Big Data analytics on process data will further increase them.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The New York Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/12/sunday-review/big-datas-impact-in-the-world.html">talks</a> about the impact of Big Data across a variety of fields, including retailing, voice recognition, and public health. They cite a report by Prof. Erik Brynjolfsson from MIT Sloan that</p>

<blockquote><p>studied 179 large companies and found that those adopting “data-driven decision making” achieved productivity gains that were 5 percent to 6 percent higher than other factors could explain.</p></blockquote>

<p>Certainly we can expect a larger impact in productivity gains in manufacturing. Traditional &ldquo;data driven&rdquo; techniques like process monitoring has itself brought productivity gains of over 10%. Big Data Analytics gives the opportunity to wring out further gains, because of the ability to handle unstructured data, which the article mentions:</p>

<blockquote><p>Data is not only becoming more available but also more understandable to computers. Most of the Big Data surge is data in the wild — unruly stuff like words, images and video on the Web and those streams of sensor data. It is called unstructured data and is not typically grist for traditional databases.</p></blockquote>

<p>But the computer tools for gleaning knowledge and insights from the Internet era’s vast trove of unstructured data are fast gaining ground. At the forefront are the rapidly advancing techniques of artificial intelligence like natural-language processing, pattern recognition and machine learning.</p>

<p>We apply similar tools and techniques to look at unstructured manufacturing data. More about this coming up!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The BEC standard discussed in the last post was applied in comparing the performance of three similar small-sized Lathes. The three devices were as follows (all brand names anonymized to protect the innocent!):</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/2012-02-08-BEC-Case-Study-1-A.png"></p>

<p>The test conditions were as follows:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/2012-02-08-BEC-Case-Study-1-B.png"></p>

<p>The BEC metric for the three devices is as follows:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/2012-02-08-BEC-Case-Study-1-C.png"></p>

<p>Here is how the metric looks broken down into its components:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/2012-02-08-BEC-Case-Study-1-D.png"></p>

<p>The results showed that Device A consumes significantly less energy than Device B and Device C. Extrapolating the BEC metric, the estimated annual energy usage for these machine tools can be calculated assuming that each device operates for 8,000 hours per year at a cost of US $0.09 per kWh of energy; similarly, the Carbon Footprint of the devices is also calculated, assuming a footprint of 0.6 kg CO2-eq/kWh. As we can see in the table below, selecting Device A saves more than $800/year compared to Device C, and $400/year compared to Device B.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Measuring machine tool energy consumption has always been tricky because of the diversity and complexity of machine tools. We took a first stab at developing a standard to measure machine tool energy consumption as part of a project supported by General Dynamics – OTS, National Center for Defense Manufacturing and Machining (NCDMM), and AMT. We developed the Baseline Energy Consumption (BEC) metric as a standard measure of the energy consumption of machine tools along with a companion test methodology. Applications of this metric include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Estimating the approximate energy requirements of operating a machine tool to manufacture a specific part</li>
<li>Comparing the energy requirements of two machine tools that are being applied in similar activities</li>
<li>Performing Return-on-Investment calculations to justify energy efficiency improvements in machine tool and machining technologies</li>
<li>Assessing environmental impact of manufacturing processes from equipment energy consumption</li>
</ul>


<p>A key consideration in designing the test methodology was to ensure that they could be performed within a reasonable amount of a time in a standard industrial setting without requiring any special workpieces, fixtures, or equipment. This pragmatic approach was explicitly selected because the goal of this metric is to serve as a figure of merit for the energy consumption of machine tools and manufacturing equipment. This metric does not intend to serve as a precise indication of the energy required by a machine tool to manufacture a specific part or to execute a specific operation. The first edition of the standard focused on measuring the BEC of lathe-type machine tools based on recording the power consumption during a series of controlled tests.</p>

<p>The energy consumption of a machine tool in a factory environment is determined by the relative time it spends in different states, including, idle, axes movement, and cutting. To capture the effect of these states, the baseline tests measure the average power consumption during tare usage, axes / component usage, and machining usage. Tare usage is measured based on the power consumption of the machine tool when it is in standby with its peripheral units turned on. Component usage is measured based on the power consumption when the machine tool components are being exercised, without any loaded workpiece (analogous to “air-cutting”). Machining usage is measured based on power consumption  during metal cutting at a fixed spindle speed at varying material removal rates on an arbitrary workpiece. These tests are based on the observation that the energy required to remove unit volume of material in a machine tool is largely dependent on the volumetric rate of removal, or material removal rate, and not on the process parameters.</p>

<p>The BEC metric is based on the average power consumed during these states. The three terms are weighted by duration factors to estimate the energy consumed by the machine during one hour of representative operation, where it is assumed that the machine tool spends 25% of the duration in tare usage, 25% in component usage (air-cutting/warmup etc.,) and 50% in machining usage.</p>

<p>We will be following up with case studies looking at how this standard was applied in comparing different machine tools.</p>
