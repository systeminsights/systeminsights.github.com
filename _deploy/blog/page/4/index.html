  <div class="entry-content"><p>Scott Anderson, a senior economist at Wells Fargo, in an interview with the Star Tribune (hat tip to @JHJackoCMO for tweeting about this):</p>

<blockquote><p>&hellip; before 1980 there was a strong positive correlation between manufacturing and jobs, but since then that correlation has basically been turned upside down. What that means is that we&rsquo;re producing more and more, yet we&rsquo;re actually losing jobs. The extent of that shift tells us there&rsquo;s a structural change that&rsquo;s gone on that deserves a deeper look.</p></blockquote>

<p>The interesting implication here is that companies are finding ways of increasing their output even as their labor size shrinks. This places greater importance on the tools that manufacturers have available to analyze and improve the efficiency of their operations. Greater automation means that more data is being generated by more equipment and we will need ways of reasoning over them in both realtime and over longer (historical) periods. Big Data to the rescue? We think so!</p>

<p>A good example is again going back to the MTConnect Alarms discussed in the previous post. While previously shops might have had one operator per machine tool at all times, with greater automation and multi-tasking machines, one operator might be supervising a cell of several machine tools. Instead of barraging the operator with all the Alarms these machines generate, we can apply filtering and classification techniques to only display pertinent Alarms. We will examine some of these techniques in an upcoming post.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Machine Tools produce enormous quantities of Alarm data, but analyzing this data can be a challenge. We are primarily interested in finding out how Alarms can help us understand Production disruptions and downtimes. While Machine Tools tend to be chatty with alarms, the alarms contain only limited information of value. Part of the problem is the lack of descriptive alarm text. Take a look at some examples from a modern, multi-axis CNC-controlled machine tool:</p>

<ul>
<li>OVERTRAVEL ( SOFT 1 )</li>
<li>1-ROT MOTOR SENSOR ERROR 81</li>
<li>HYDRAULIC PRESSURE DOWN</li>
<li>HIGH PRESSURE COOLANT CLEAN TANK OIL LOW LEVEL</li>
<li>OIL-MATIC TEMP./FILTER ALARM</li>
<li>Y AXIS HOME POSITION RETURN REQUEST</li>
</ul>


<p>While some of these alarms are self-explanatory (like &ldquo;<code>HYDRAULIC PRESSURE DOWN</code>&rdquo;), other alarms can be a little harder to understand without any context. One way of adding context to Alarms is to look at the ControllerMode and the ExecutionStatus when the Alarm fired, and how they changed across the duration the alarm was active.</p>

<p>We took several months of data from a multi-axis CNC-controlled Lathe, and we looked at the different Alarms that occurred in this period. To keep the list manageable, we only looked at Alarms which had the severity level &ldquo;Fault&rdquo;.
Here are the alarms that occurred during this period:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/2011-12-28-Analyzing-MTConnect-Alarm-Data-AlarmCount.png"></p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/2011-12-28-Analyzing-MTConnect-Alarm-Data-AlarmDuration.png"></p>

<p>We can see that the Chuck Barrier alarm occurred the most number of of times, but was not active the longest (that distinction went to the two Spindle-related alarms). To place these alarms in better light, we can look at the <code>ControllerMode</code> and <code>ExecutionStatus</code> when these alarms were active:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/2011-12-28-Analyzing-MTConnect-Alarm-Data-AlarmDurationByExec.png"></p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/2011-12-28-Analyzing-MTConnect-Alarm-Data-AlarmDurationByMode.png"></p>

<p>We are most interested in Alarms that have stopped part production, so we can focus on those have have occurred when the <code>ExecutionStatus</code> was <code>STOPPED</code> or <code>INTERRUPTED</code>. Similarly, Alarms that occur when the Controller was in <code>Manual</code> or <code>MDI</code> mode are probably those which were a by-product of something a user was manually doing on the machine, so we can ignore those to focus on those that occurred when the mode was <code>AUTOMATIC</code>. With this filter, we can see for example that the <code>CHUCK BARRIER</code> alarm which occurred the most number of times, seems to have exclusively occurred when the ExecutionStatus was <code>READY</code> (implying that it was not interrupting program execution) and when the ControllerMode was <code>MANUAL</code> (implying that a user was manually operating the machine when the alarm fired). The two Spindle Alarms now look more interesting, since they occurred when the ExecutionStatus was <code>STOPPED</code>, and the ControllerMode was both <code>AUTOMATIC</code> and <code>MANUAL</code>. This can imply that this alarm did interrupt production, and that it led the the Mode being changed from <code>AUTOMATIC</code> to <code>MANUAL</code>.</p>

<p>We can dig one level deeper, and look at the combined state mapped by the <code>ControllerMode</code> and <code>ExecutionStatus</code>:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/2011-12-28-Analyzing-MTConnect-Alarm-Data-AlarmDurationByState.png"></p>

<p>This gives us even more clarity: we can see that two Spindle Alarms switched two states â€“ between <code>STOPPED/AUTOMATIC</code> and <code>STOPPED/MANUAL</code>, further confirming that this Alarm did stop program execution, and that the mode changed from <code>AUTOMATIC</code> to <code>MANUAL</code>.</p>

<p>Given the lack of clarity in alarm data, looking at the <code>ControllerMode</code> and <code>ExecutionStatus</code> gives us a better understanding of Alarms that can have an impact on Production. In vimana, we filter Alarms based on the <code>ControllerMode</code> and <code>ExecutionStatus</code> so that we can filter and look at only those that interrupt Production. We also look at temporal patterns between alarms, so that the ordering of alarms can be studied to better understand the phenomena they are describing. Downtimes are classified based on these characteristics of alarms. These will be discussed in this blog in an upcoming post.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Big Data has increasingly been in the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/26/technology/for-start-ups-sorting-the-data-cloud-is-the-next-big-thing.html?pagewanted=all">news</a>, and is being touted as a kind of universal panacea to improve efficiency, decrease costs, and make the world a better place. We like keeping the conversation a lot more focused, and this blog will focus on Big Data from the manufacturing shop floor: how to collect it and more importantly, what to make of it.</p>

<p>What kind of data is available from the manufacturing shop floor? Here are some examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>Operational: Device uptime, downtime, modes, states</li>
<li>Diagnostic: Alarms, warnings, messages, notifications</li>
<li>Process: Positions, velocities, acceleration, flow rates</li>
<li>Environmental: Resource usage, energy consumption, effluents and emissions</li>
</ul>


<p>So, what can we do with Manufacturing Big Data?</p>

<ul>
<li>Preventive Maintenance: Big Data can help us identify which devices are going to be fail by comparing their current operational patterns with past failure behavior. By mining across data from similar devices, we can even predict the failure of devices that have not failed in the past.</li>
<li>Part genealogy: Big Data can be used to build detailed genealogical models of complex parts, bringing together data on device operational states, process parameters, and machine health.</li>
<li>Design-to-manufacturing pipeline: Big Data can improve design decisions by enabling the use of manufacturing operational and diagnostic data to the design phase.</li>
</ul>


<p>At System Insights we apply Big Data to improve the efficiency and productivity of complex manufacturing systems. Our vimana software application is the first of its kind solution for the high speed collection, storage, and analysis of data from the manufacturing shop floor.</p>
